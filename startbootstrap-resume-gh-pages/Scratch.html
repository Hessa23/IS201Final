        <p class="subtitle"> What is Vocal Performance?</p>
            <p>Vocal performance is the act of singing for an audience. My experience with vocal performance with the most part has been with my time in showchoir. During my performances, we would sing and dance as a group or in solos for an audience as part of a showcase show. </p>

        <p class="subtitle"> Why am I passionate about singing?</p>
            <p> Why am I passionate about singing? Because it brings me joy! Throughout my whole life, music has brought me comfort and has helped me to let out my emotions that sometimes I keep bottled up. Vocal performance has given me an outlet and a way for me to simply be myself.</p>
